# You.Haiku privacy policy
Privacy Policy page for the You.Haiku Windows 10 app

## *Data collected*

No actual user data (photos, texts, messages, calls or anything else) is collected by the application, nor transmited to any external or third party company.
Also, there is no login information needed or stored to use the application. It is a single user, no social network type of application. Internet access is not required.

The only thing the application gathers is application usage information for bug fixing, crash dumps, through the Application Insights API from Microsoft.
This is used by the developer to track bugs, crashes and provide a better version at each release by fixing the problems that occur on different devices.

## *Application capabilities*

The application has the capability to create photos and store them in its internal application storage on the phone. The photos can be shared over the
Internet, but only with user consent the from menu items or functionality started by the user. The application does not do this by itself.

Also, the user can copy the photos created by the application to the main Windows Photos application storage, by accessing the "Save picture to Photos app" functionality.

The application accesses Location data, but this can be turned off by the user at Settings->Privacy->Location page on the phone. This information might be used by future functionality where the user would be able to see the locations where the photos were created, on a map (not implemented yet).

## *Data security*

Photos stored in the application storage on the phone are secured from other applications running on the same device. This is provided by the Microsoft APIs.
